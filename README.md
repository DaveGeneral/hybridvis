HybridVis
=========

HybridVis creates visualizations using the hybrid image method [1].

**This software is supplied for experimentation and to make it possible to reproduce the paper results, but we are not committed to maintaining it.**

## Building HybridVis

The build is managed by `ant`.

`ant run` will build and run the software

`ant uberjar` will build an archive containing the software and all of its 
dependencies.
